# To-Do List API Project

### Skills and Technologies Used:
- REST API Design
- JSON
- Basic Authentication Middleware

## Project Overview

The **To-Do List API** project focuses on creating a backend service for managing tasks in a To-Do application. Unlike a basic CRUD operation project, this API introduces authentication and more advanced task management capabilities.

### Key Features:
1. **Authentication Logic**: 
   - Implement basic authentication middleware.
   - Manage a table for users and their credentials (username/password).
   
2. **User and Task Management**:
   - Create and manage users.
   - Create tasks associated with specific users.

3. **Task Operations**:
   - Update tasks, including changing their status (e.g., completed or pending).
   - Delete tasks as needed.
   
4. **Task Queries**:
   - Get a list of all tasks.
   - Filter tasks by their status (e.g., pending, completed).
   - Retrieve detailed information about individual tasks.
